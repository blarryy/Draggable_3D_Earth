    //IMPORTANT
    //The general idea of the mathematical process is this :There are 4 different ways to describe the rotation of a 3d object. D3 uses EULER ANGLE to describe rotations, but it is easier to calculate if we use QUATERNION to describe rotations. So we take EULER ANGLE data generated from d3 when dragging starts, converse it to QUATERNION, then use QUATERNION to calculate the new QUATERNION that describes new position, and converse the new QUATERNION to new EULER ANGLE and feed it back to D3, describing new position after the drag. We converse quaternion back because D3 can only use Euler angles.     
    
    
var render = function() {}, //Declare 4 crucial variables, render() function paints canvas(i.e. draw the earth), v0, r0, q0 are three arrays that are                                   necessary for the calculation of position after the drag.
    v0, // Mouse position in Cartesian coordinates at start of drag gesture.
    r0, // Projection rotation in EULER ANGLE at start of drag.
    q0; // Projection rotation as QUATERNION at start of drag. This is the quaternion that is conversed from euler angle.And the euler angle that conversion uses is the current location on which mouse is clickd. Therefore this quaternion also represents the location on which mouse is clicked.

                                                            //projection.invert(d3.mouse(this)) returns spherical coordinates [λ, φ]. Cartesian(),which is  // written in versor.js converse spherical coordinates to Cartesian coordinates.
  r0 = projection.rotate();             //In d3 API, it states that if rotation is not specified, rotate() returns the current rotation . Because it is not                                         specified, it will always return the current location when drag starts.So r0 is the mouse position in Euler angle                                         at start of drag gesture.
